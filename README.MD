My brother grew up with Asthma, and I have since developed symptomps since moving to New York City. As a teacher, I was alarmed at how many of my student's had asthma, especially compared to how few of my peers seemed to have it while growing up. The NYC department estimates that the rate of Asthma for children growing up in NYC was almost twice that of the nation as a whole. Causes including cockroaches, smoke and other air pollutants. In 2011, Mayor Bloomberg passed legistlation to phase out #4 and #6 oil boilers; apartment oil boilers burning dirty oil that produce 5-12 times the PM 2.5 pollution of the more modern #2 oil boilers, not to mention natural gas, which is even cleaner. Attached is a presentation of my analysis of the effectiveness of this program, put together while I was a student of the GIS Certificate Program at Hunter College.
